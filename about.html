            <p>"Leaving my Ozzy is always nerve-wracking, but Paws & Tails Haven changed that. They did not just provide a kennel but they provided a home away from home. I receive daily updates and photos that show that my Ozzy is looking relaxed and loved. I finally enjoyed my vacation without the 'dog parent' guilt"

            <p>"I needed a running partner who could keep us with my 5-mile trails and the team introduced me to both 'Yuki' and 'Diesel'. They were honest about their energy levels and gave me great tips on mental stimulation. Now they are my best friends on the trail and the biggest cuddle bugs on the couch once I get home. Paws & Tails know how to match drive with lifestyle!"
